title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Zeqin Yu, and I am currently a third-year PhD student at Sun Yat-sen University (*Sep 2023 - Jun 2027*). My research interests are primarily focused on **Multimedia Forensics and Security**, particularly in detecting and preventing manipulation and forgery of images, videos, and other media content. 

I also have extensive experience in [competitions](#honors--awards) and data creation, particularly with real-world tampered images and videos.

If you are interested in my research or would like to explore collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out! **I am also currently looking for internship or exchange student opportunities!**
